# Deprecated Files
These files are left for legacy purposes to serve as baselines, templates, or core ideas for further development.

## `morg_http_client.py`
- This API has been detected as being abused, and is thus banned.
- It stands here as an example of how to set up a local HTTP server.

## `status_socket.py`
- This API, like the Morg API, has been detected and banned.
- The code is left as another example of how to set up API endpoints.

## `parse_diary_data.py`
- This file is useful for testing diary data.
- As of this readme, there is a small accounting bug.
- Either way, this script stands as a basic template for testing diary data serialization, but it should be improved once the bug is found and fixed.
